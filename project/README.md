## Secure online auction website

Auction sites are a useful tool to promote the exchange of goods directly exploiting the demand
and request needs of dynamic markets. The goal of this work is to create an on-line auction store,
providing sellers and buyers a reliable website with all the mechanisms for the secure transactions
of products and goods. The site must be secure against the threats like XSS and SQL injection
and/or other attacks.

The solution should consider all layers explicitly, including: web layer, application server layer,
database layer; and their respective servers. The network topology should be adequately designed
having in mind the need functional and assurance requirements with security in mind.

A banking system can be considered as another secure website to be developed by the students or
a simple server application (with the most basic interface and without security).
